## General

After a lot of sweat and tears, endless googling and research I managed to transform the static memory game into an interactive one. Basically rewrote this code a billion times until I had to go back to the "roots" of the code and take the basic layout which Udacity gave us. I'd really like to thank random people on the web who helped me figure things out as well. I'll keep on trying my best and trying to become a front end web developer.


## Rules

  1. Flip one card at a time until you get a pair.
  2. You can only flip two cards at once.
  3. Once you have a pair you can keep on flipping other cards.
  4. Flip all 8 pairs and you win!
  5. Do your best and try to get all 3 stars in the fastest time.
  6. Have fun!!
